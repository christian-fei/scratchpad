## agile in a nutshell
"Deliver somethign working, and of value every week". What does it take to do so?
Start looking at the software delivery from the customer`s point of view and you`ll
realize that working software released every week is fare more valuable (and important)
than documentation, plans and reports!

Documentation and plans are important, but only to enable working software, which is far
more important. Continuous testing, making sure the codebase is in the most optimal state,
this to avoid big-bang integrations, testing and surprises..

Also getting feedback is at the heart of agile software development. Without the feedback
from the customer, you`re driving on the highway through the fog without any light or
reference point, and you might get into a serious accident.

Agile principle: "Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continous 
delivery of valuable software."
